# 42. Trapping Rain Water

## Problem Statement

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

## Constraints
* `n == height.length`
* `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
* `0 <= height[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution: Two-Pointer Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0

        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_left, max_right = height[left], height[right]
        trapped_water = 0

        while left < right:
            if height[left] <= height[right]:
                trapped_water += max_left - height[left]
                left += 1
                max_left = max(max_left, height[left])
            else:
                trapped_water += max_right - height[right]
                right -= 1
                max_right = max(max_right, height[right])
            
        return trapped_water
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the height array
  - We process each element at most once using the two-pointer approach
  - Each operation inside the loop takes constant time

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a constant number of variables regardless of the input size
