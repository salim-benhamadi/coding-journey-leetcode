# 3232. Find if Digit Game Can Be Won

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of **positive** integers `nums`.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. In the game, Alice can choose **either** all single-digit numbers or all double-digit numbers from `nums`, and the rest of the numbers are given to Bob. Alice wins if the sum of her numbers is **strictly greater** than the sum of Bob's numbers.

Return `true` if Alice can win this game, otherwise, return `false`.

## Input
* `nums`: An array of positive integers where `1 <= nums[i] <= 99`

## Output
* A boolean: `true` if Alice can win, `false` otherwise

## Constraints
* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 99`

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,10]
Output: false
Explanation: Alice cannot win by choosing either single-digit or double-digit numbers.
Single-digit sum: 1+2+3+4 = 10
Double-digit sum: 10
Both sums are equal, so Alice cannot win.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,14]
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can win by choosing single-digit numbers which have a sum equal to 15.
Single-digit sum: 1+2+3+4+5 = 15
Double-digit sum: 14
Since 15 > 14, Alice wins by choosing single-digit numbers.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [5,5,5,25]
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can win by choosing double-digit numbers which have a sum equal to 25.
Single-digit sum: 5+5+5 = 15
Double-digit sum: 25
Since 25 > 15, Alice wins by choosing double-digit numbers.
```

## Solution: Sum Comparison Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def canAliceWin(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        single_digit_sum = sum([num for num in nums if num < 10])
        double_digit_sum = sum([num for num in nums if num > 9])
        return single_digit_sum != double_digit_sum
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array
  - Two passes through the array to calculate both sums
  - Each filtering and summing operation is linear

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only storing two sum variables
  - List comprehensions create temporary lists but they're not counted as auxiliary space
