# 605. Can Place Flowers

## Problem Statement

You have a flowerbed where some plots are planted (1) and some are empty (0). Flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots. Given an integer array `flowerbed` and an integer `n`, determine if `n` new flowers can be planted without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```python
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
* `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`
* There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`
* `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        slots = 0
        flowerbed = [0] + flowerbed + [0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(flowerbed)-1):
            if (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0 and 
                flowerbed[i] == 0 and 
                flowerbed[i + 1] == 0):
                slots += 1
                flowerbed[i] = 1
                
        return slots >= n
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of flowerbed
  - We traverse the flowerbed array once
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We create a new array with two additional elements
