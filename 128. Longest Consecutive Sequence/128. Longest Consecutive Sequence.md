# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.*

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
```

## Constraints
* `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution: Hash Set Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        longest = 0
        numsSet = set(nums)
        for n in numsSet:
            if n-1 not in numsSet:
                length = 0
                while n + length in numsSet:
                    length += 1
                longest = max(longest, length)
        return longest
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array
  - We iterate through each number in the array once
  - The while loop might seem like it could lead to O(nÂ²), but each element will only be visited once across all while loop iterations combined
  - Set operations (lookup, insertion) are O(1) on average

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We store all elements in a set, which in the worst case requires O(n) space
