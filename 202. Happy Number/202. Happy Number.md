# 202. Happy Number

## Problem Statement

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:
1. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
2. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
3. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```python
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1² + 9² = 82
8² + 2² = 68
6² + 8² = 100
1² + 0² + 0² = 1
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= n <= 2³¹ - 1`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        visited = set([n])
        while True:
            n = sum([int(c)**2 for c in str(n)])
            if n == 1: return True
            if n in visited: return False
            visited.add(n)
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - The number of digits in a number is O(log n)
  - The number of iterations needed to reach 1 or detect a cycle is bounded
- **Space Complexity**: O(log n)
  - We store numbers in the visited set
  - In the worst case, we might store several numbers before finding a cycle
