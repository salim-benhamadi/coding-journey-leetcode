# 2974. Minimum Number Game

## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of even length and there is also an empty array `arr`. Alice and Bob decided to play a game where in every round Alice and Bob will do one move. The rules of the game are as follows:

* Every round, first Alice will remove the minimum element from `nums`, and then Bob does the same.
* Now, first Bob will append the removed element in the array `arr`, and then Alice does the same.
* The game continues until `nums` becomes empty.

Return the resulting array `arr`.

## Input
* `nums`: An integer array of even length where `2 <= nums.length <= 100` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Output
* An integer array representing the resulting array after the game

## Constraints
* `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
* `nums.length % 2 == 0`

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [5,4,2,3]
Output: [3,2,5,4]
Explanation: 
Round 1: Alice removes 2, Bob removes 3. Bob appends 3, Alice appends 2. arr = [3,2]
Round 2: Alice removes 4, Bob removes 5. Bob appends 5, Alice appends 4. arr = [3,2,5,4]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,5]
Output: [5,2]
Explanation: 
Round 1: Alice removes 2, Bob removes 5. Bob appends 5, Alice appends 2. arr = [5,2]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [2,1,4,3,6,5]
Explanation: 
Round 1: Alice removes 1, Bob removes 2. arr = [2,1]
Round 2: Alice removes 3, Bob removes 4. arr = [2,1,4,3]
Round 3: Alice removes 5, Bob removes 6. arr = [2,1,4,3,6,5]
```

## Solution: Sort and Swap Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def numberGame(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = sorted(nums)
        for i in range(0, len(result) - 1, 2):
            result[i], result[i + 1] = result[i + 1], result[i]
        return result
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the length of nums
  - Sorting the array: O(n log n)
  - Swapping adjacent pairs: O(n)
  - Overall: O(n log n) dominated by sorting

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Sorted array requires O(n) space
  - Depending on sorting implementation, may use O(log n) or O(n) additional space
