# 387. First Unique Character in a String

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the **first** non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it **does not** exist, return `-1`.

## Input
* `s`: A string consisting of only lowercase English letters where `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`

## Output
* An integer representing the index of the first unique character, or `-1` if none exists

## Constraints
* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Explanation: The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The character 'v' at index 2 is the first unique character.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
Explanation: All characters appear more than once.
```

## Solution: Hash Map Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_frequency = {}
        n = len(s)
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] in char_frequency:
                char_frequency[s[i]] = -1
            else:
                char_frequency[s[i]] = i
        
        for char in char_frequency:
            if char_frequency[char] != -1:
                return char_frequency[char] 
        return -1
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string
  - First loop iterates through all characters once: O(n)
  - Second loop iterates through unique characters (at most 26): O(1)
  - Overall: O(n) + O(1) = O(n)

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Hash map stores at most 26 lowercase English letters
  - Constant space regardless of input size
