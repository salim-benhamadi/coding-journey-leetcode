# 392. Is Subsequence

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` *if* `s` *is a **subsequence** of* `t`, *or* `false` *otherwise*.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

## Constraints
* `0 <= s.length <= 100`
* `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
* `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        subsequence_index = 0
        len_t, len_s = len(t), len(s)
        
        for main_index in range(len_t):
            if subsequence_index == len_s:
                return True
            if t[main_index] == s[subsequence_index]:
                subsequence_index += 1
        
        return subsequence_index == len_s
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of string t
  - We scan through t once
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size
