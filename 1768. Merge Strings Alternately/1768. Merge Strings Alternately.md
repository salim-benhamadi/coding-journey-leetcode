# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately
## Problem Description
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

## Runtime
- 36 ms

## Memory
- 16.52 MB

## Intuition
My initial thoughts were to iterate through both strings simultaneously, appending characters alternately to create the merged string.

## Approach
I used a while loop to iterate through both strings simultaneously, appending characters alternately until one of the strings is exhausted. Then, I appended the remaining characters from both strings to the merged string.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(max(len(word1), len(word2)))
  - The algorithm iterates through both strings simultaneously, and in the worst case, it will iterate through the longer string completely.
- Space complexity: O(len(word1) + len(word2))
  - The space used is proportional to the length of the merged string, which is the sum of the lengths of word1 and word2.

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        merged = ""
        i = 0
        while i < len(word1) and i < len(word2):
            merged += word1[i] + word2[i]
            i += 1
        return merged + word1[i:] + word2[i:]
```
