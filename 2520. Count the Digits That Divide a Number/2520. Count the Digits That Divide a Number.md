# 2520. Count the Digits That Divide a Number

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `num`, return the number of digits in `num` that divide `num`.

An integer `val` divides `nums` if `nums % val == 0`.

## Input
* `num`: An integer where `1 <= num <= 10^9`

## Output
* An integer representing the count of digits that divide `num`

## Constraints
* `1 <= num <= 10^9`
* `num` does not contain 0 as one of its digits

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: num = 7
Output: 1
Explanation: 7 divides itself, hence the answer is 1.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: num = 121
Output: 2
Explanation: 121 is divisible by 1, but not 2. Since 1 occurs twice as a digit, we return 2.
The digits are: 1 (divides), 2 (does not divide), 1 (divides) = 2 total
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: num = 1248
Output: 4
Explanation: 1248 is divisible by all of its digits, hence the answer is 4.
1248 % 1 = 0 ✓
1248 % 2 = 0 ✓
1248 % 4 = 0 ✓
1248 % 8 = 0 ✓
```

## Solution: Digit Extraction Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def countDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        remaining = num 
        while remaining > 0:
            digit = remaining % 10
            if num % digit == 0:
                count += 1
            remaining //= 10
        
        return count
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the value of num
  - Number of iterations equals the number of digits in num
  - For a number n, the number of digits is log₁₀(n) + 1
  - Each iteration performs constant time operations

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using constant extra space for variables
  - No additional data structures needed
