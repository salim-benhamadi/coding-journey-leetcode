# 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

## Problem Statement

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already ***sorted in non-decreasing order***, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return *the indices of the two numbers,* `index1` *and* `index2`, ***added by one*** *as an integer array* `[index1, index2]` *of length 2.*

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

## Constraints
* `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4`
* `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
* `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
* `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
* The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.

## Solution 1: Hash Map Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_to_index = dict()
        
        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            complement = target - numbers[i]
            
            if complement in num_to_index:
                return [num_to_index[complement], i+1]
                
            num_to_index[numbers[i]] = i+1
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array
  - We iterate through the array once
  - Hash map operations (lookup, insertion) are O(1) on average

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We use additional space to store up to n elements in the dictionary

## Solution 2: Brute Force Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for first_index in range(len(numbers)):
            first_num = numbers[first_index]
            complement = target - first_num
            
            if complement in numbers[first_index+1:]:
                second_index = first_index+1
                
                while second_index < len(numbers):
                    if numbers[second_index] == complement:
                        return [first_index+1, second_index+1]
                    second_index += 1

```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) in the worst case
  - The outer loop runs n times
  - The inner while loop could run up to n times in the worst case

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a few variables regardless of input size
  - This meets the requirement of using only constant extra space
