# 151. Reverse Words in a String

## Problem Statement

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space, removing any extra spaces.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```python
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Removed leading and trailing spaces
```

### Example 3:
```python
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: Reduced multiple spaces to single space
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= s.length <= 104`
* `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`
* There is **at least one** word in `s`

## Method 1 : List-based Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        word = []
        result = []
        
        for char in s:
            if char != " ":
                word.append(char)
            elif word:
                result.insert(0, "".join(word))
                word = []
                
        if word:
            result.insert(0, "".join(word))
            
        return " ".join(result)
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of string s
  - Single pass through the string
  - Each character is processed once
  - insert(0) operations on result list add O(k) where k is number of words
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Space for word and result lists
  - Space for final joined string

## Method 2 : Python Built-ins

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        return " ".join(s.split()[::-1])
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - split() performs one pass through string
  - join() performs one pass through words
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Space for array of split words
  - Space for final joined string
