# 136. Single Number

## Problem Statement

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
* `-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4`
* Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0

        for num in nums:
            result ^= num

        return result
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array
  - We iterate through the array once
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a single variable regardless of input size
