# 2535. Difference Between Element Sum and Digit Sum of an Array

## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer array `nums`.

* The **element sum** is the sum of all the elements in `nums`.
* The **digit sum** is the sum of all the digits (not necessarily distinct) that appear in `nums`.

Return the **absolute difference** between the element sum and digit sum of `nums`.

Note that the absolute difference between two integers `x` and `y` is defined as `|x - y|`.

## Input
* `nums`: A positive integer array where `1 <= nums.length <= 2000` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 2000`

## Output
* An integer representing the absolute difference between element sum and digit sum

## Constraints
* `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 2000`

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,15,6,3]
Output: 9
Explanation: 
The element sum of nums is 1 + 15 + 6 + 3 = 25.
The digit sum of nums is 1 + 1 + 5 + 6 + 3 = 16.
The absolute difference between the element sum and digit sum is |25 - 16| = 9.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The element sum of nums is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
The digit sum of nums is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
The absolute difference between the element sum and digit sum is |10 - 10| = 0.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [100,200,300]
Output: 594
Explanation:
The element sum is 100 + 200 + 300 = 600.
The digit sum is 1+0+0 + 2+0+0 + 3+0+0 = 6.
The absolute difference is |600 - 6| = 594.
```

## Solution 1: Single Pass Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def differenceOfSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        element_sum = 0
        digit_sum = 0

        for num in nums:
            element_sum += num
            while num > 0:
                digit_sum += num % 10
                num //= 10

        return abs(element_sum - digit_sum)
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n × d), where n is the length of array and d is the average number of digits
  - Iterate through all n elements
  - For each element, extract d digits (d ≤ 4 for nums[i] ≤ 2000)
  - Overall: O(n × d)

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using constant extra space for variables
  - No additional data structures needed
