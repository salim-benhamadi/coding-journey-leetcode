# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Problem Statement
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day. Your goal is to maximize profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock. Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```python
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10⁵`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10⁴`

## Solutions

### Method 1: Brute Force Approach
```python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    max_profit = 0
    for i in range(len(prices)-1):
        tmp = max(prices[i+1:]) - prices[i]
        if tmp > max_profit:
            max_profit = tmp
    return max_profit
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²), where n is the length of the prices array
  - Outer loop iterates through each price
  - Inner `max()` function requires another pass through the remaining prices
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using a constant amount of extra space

### Method 2: Sliding Window Approach
```python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        min_price = min(min_price, price)
        current_profit = price - min_price
        max_profit = max(max_profit, current_profit)
    
    return max_profit
```

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the prices array
  - Single pass through the prices array
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using constant extra space for tracking minimum price and maximum profit
