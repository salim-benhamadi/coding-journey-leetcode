# 347. Top K Frequent Elements

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *most frequent elements*. You may return the answer in **any order**.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
* `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
* It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.

## Solution: Bucket Sort Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        count = {}
        freq = [[] for _ in range(len(nums)+1)]
        output = []
        
        for n in nums:
            count[n] = count.get(n,0) +1
        
        for i in count:
            freq[count[i]].append(i)
        
        for i in freq:
            output += i
            
        return output[-k:]
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array
  - Counting frequency of each element is O(n)
  - Creating the frequency buckets is O(n) in the worst case
  - Flattening the buckets to get the output is also O(n)
  - All operations combined still result in O(n) time complexity

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The count dictionary stores at most n keys (in case all elements are unique)
  - The freq list contains n+1 buckets
  - The output list will contain at most k elements, where k â‰¤ n
