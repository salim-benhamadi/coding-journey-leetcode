# 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

## Problem Statement

Given the array `nums`, for each `nums[i]` find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each `nums[i]` you have to count the number of valid j's such that `j != i` and `nums[j] < nums[i]`.

Return the answer in an array.

## Input
* `nums`: An integer array where `2 <= nums.length <= 500` and `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Output
* An integer array where each element represents the count of smaller numbers for the corresponding input element

## Constraints
* `2 <= nums.length <= 500`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]
Explanation:
6 has 2 smaller (5, 4)
5 has 1 smaller (4)
4 has 0 smaller
8 has 3 smaller (6, 5, 4)
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]
Explanation:
All numbers are equal, so no number is smaller than any other.
```

## Solution 1: Sorting with Hash Map Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def smallerNumbersThanCurrent(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        index_map = {}
        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
        
        for i, num in enumerate(sorted_nums):
            if num not in index_map:
                index_map[num] = i
        
        result = [index_map[num] for num in nums]
        return result
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the length of the array
  - Sorting: O(n log n)
  - Building hash map: O(n)
  - Creating result: O(n)
  - Overall: O(n log n)

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Sorted array: O(n)
  - Hash map: O(k) where k is number of unique elements (k ≤ n)
  - Result array: O(n)
  - Overall: O(n)

## Solution 2: Brute Force Approach

```python
class Solution2:
    def smallerNumbersThanCurrent(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = [0] * len(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(len(nums)):
                if i != j and nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    result[i] += 1
        return result
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²), where n is the length of the array
  - Nested loops iterate through all pairs
  - Each comparison is O(1)

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Result array: O(n)
  - No additional data structures
