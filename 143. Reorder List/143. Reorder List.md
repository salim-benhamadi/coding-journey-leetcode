# 143. Reorder List

## Problem Statement

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

```
L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
```

*Reorder the list to be on the following form:*

```
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
```

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

## Constraints
* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution: Three-Step Approach

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        
        # Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list
        slow, fast = head, head.next

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # Step 2: Split the list and reverse the second half
        second_list = slow.next
        slow.next = None
        
        node = second_list
        previous_node = None

        while node:
            next_node = node.next
            node.next = previous_node
            previous_node = node
            node = next_node
        
        # Step 3: Merge the two lists alternately
        second_list = previous_node
        node = head
        
        while node and second_list:
            tmp = node.next
            tmp2 = second_list.next
            node.next = second_list
            second_list.next = tmp

            node = tmp
            second_list = tmp2
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
  - Finding the middle takes O(n) time
  - Reversing the second half takes O(n/2) time
  - Merging the two halves takes O(n/2) time
  - Overall: O(n) + O(n/2) + O(n/2) = O(n)

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space for pointers
  - The algorithm modifies the list in-place without using additional data structures
