# 191. Number of 1 Bits (Hamming Weight)

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation, also known as the Hamming weight.

The Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet used. In our case, for binary numbers, it's the count of '1' bits.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```python
Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Binary representation: 1011
Number of 1 bits: 3
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: n = 128
Output: 1
Explanation:
Binary representation: 10000000
Number of 1 bits: 1
```

### Example 3:
```python
Input: n = 2147483645
Output: 30
Explanation:
Binary representation: 1111111111111111111111111111101
Number of 1 bits: 30
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= n <= 2³¹ - 1`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        number_of_bits = 1
        while n // 2 != 0:
            number_of_bits += n % 2
            n //= 2
        return number_of_bits
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - We iterate through each bit of the number
  - The number of iterations is proportional to the number of bits (log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a single variable to keep track of the count

### Alternative Approache
Using bit manipulation:
```python
def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    while n:
        n &= (n-1)
        count += 1
    return count
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The operation n & (n-1) clears exactly one set bit (changes one 1 to 0) in each iteration
  - The loop continues only until all set bits are cleared
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only uses a single variable (count) regardless of input size
  - No additional space is needed as operations are performed in-place
