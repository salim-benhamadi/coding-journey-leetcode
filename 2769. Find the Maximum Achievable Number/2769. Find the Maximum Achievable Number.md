# 2769. Find the Maximum Achievable Number

## Problem Statement

Given two integers, `num` and `t`. A number `x` is achievable if it can become equal to `num` after applying the following operation at most `t` times:

* Increase or decrease `x` by `1`, and simultaneously increase or decrease `num` by `1`.

Return the maximum possible value of `x`.

## Input
* `num`: An integer where `1 <= num <= 50`
* `t`: An integer where `1 <= t <= 50`

## Output
* An integer representing the maximum achievable value of `x`

## Constraints
* `1 <= num, t <= 50`

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: num = 4, t = 1
Output: 6
Explanation:
Apply the following operation once to make the maximum achievable number equal to num:
- Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase num by 1.
Starting: x = 6, num = 4
After operation: x = 5, num = 5 (they are now equal)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: num = 3, t = 2
Output: 7
Explanation:
Apply the following operation twice to make the maximum achievable number equal to num:
Operation 1: x = 6, num = 4
Operation 2: x = 5, num = 5 (they are now equal)
Maximum x we can start with is 7.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: num = 10, t = 5
Output: 20
Explanation:
We can start with x = 20 and apply the operation 5 times.
Each operation decreases x by 1 and increases num by 1.
After 5 operations: x = 15, num = 15 (equal)
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: num = 1, t = 1
Output: 3
Explanation:
Starting with x = 3, num = 1.
After 1 operation: x = 2, num = 2 (equal)
```

## Solution: Mathematical Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def theMaximumAchievableX(self, num: int, t: int) -> int:
        return num + 2 * t
```
