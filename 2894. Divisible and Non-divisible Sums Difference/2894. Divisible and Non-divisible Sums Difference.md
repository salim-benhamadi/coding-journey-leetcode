# 2894. Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference

## Problem Statement

You are given positive integers `n` and `m`.

Define two integers as follows:
* `num1`: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are not divisible by m
* `num2`: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are divisible by m

Return the integer `num1 - num2`.

## Input
* `n`: A positive integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`
* `m`: A positive integer where `1 <= m <= 1000`

## Output
* An integer representing the difference between non-divisible and divisible sums

## Constraints
* `1 <= n, m <= 1000`

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 10, m = 3
Output: 19
Explanation: 
- Integers not divisible by 3: [1,2,4,5,7,8,10], sum = 37
- Integers divisible by 3: [3,6,9], sum = 18
Result = 37 - 18 = 19
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5, m = 6
Output: 15
Explanation: 
- Integers not divisible by 6: [1,2,3,4,5], sum = 15
- Integers divisible by 6: [], sum = 0
Result = 15 - 0 = 15
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 5, m = 1
Output: -15
Explanation: 
- Integers not divisible by 1: [], sum = 0
- Integers divisible by 1: [1,2,3,4,5], sum = 15
Result = 0 - 15 = -15
```

## Solution: Single Pass Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def differenceOfSums(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        difference = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % m == 0:
                difference -= i
            else:
                difference += i
        
        return difference
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the upper limit
  - Single loop iterating from 1 to n
  - Each iteration performs constant time operations

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using constant extra space for the difference variable
