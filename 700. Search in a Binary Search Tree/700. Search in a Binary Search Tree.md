# 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree

## Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer `val`.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals `val` and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return `null`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []
```

## Constraints
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 5000]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 10^7`
* `root` is a binary search tree.
* `1 <= val <= 10^7`

## Solution 1 : Using Stack

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        stack = [root]
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            
            if node.val == val:
                return node
                
            if node.right:
                stack.append(node.right)
            if node.left:
                stack.append(node.left)
        
        return None
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST
  - In the worst case, we may need to visit all nodes in the tree
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the BST
  - The stack will contain at most h nodes, where h is the height of the tree

## Solution 2 : Using Binary Search Tree Properties

Since this is a Binary Search Tree (BST), we can take advantage of its properties to perform a more efficient search:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        current = root
        
        while current:
            if current.val == val:
                return current
            elif val < current.val:
                current = current.left
            else:
                current = current.right
        
        return None
```

### Complexity Analysis for Improved Solution
- **Time Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the BST
  - In a balanced BST, this would be O(log n)
  - In the worst case (skewed tree), this would be O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a constant amount of space regardless of input size
