# 1732. Find the Highest Altitude

## Problem Statement

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point `0` with altitude equal `0`.

You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n` where `gain[i]` is the **net gain in altitude** between points `i`​​​​ and `i + 1` for all (`0 <= i < n`). Return *the **highest altitude** of a point.*

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
```

## Constraints
* `n == gain.length`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `-100 <= gain[i] <= 100`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def largestAltitude(self, gain: List[int]) -> int:
        highest_altitude = 0
        current_altitude = 0
        for n in gain:
            current_altitude += n
            highest_altitude = max(highest_altitude, current_altitude)
        return highest_altitude
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array
  - We iterate through the array once
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use two variables regardless of input size
