# 155. Min Stack

## Problem Statement

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:
* `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
* `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
* `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
* `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
* `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
```

## Constraints
* `-2^31 <= val <= 2^31 - 1`
* Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks.
* At most `3 * 10^4` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.

## Solution: Two Stack Approach

```python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.minStack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.stack.append(val)
        val = min(val, self.minStack[-1] if self.minStack else val)
        self.minStack.append(val)

    def pop(self) -> None:
        self.stack.pop()
        self.minStack.pop()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.minStack[-1]
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for all operations
  - `push()`: O(1) - append operations are constant time
  - `pop()`: O(1) - pop operations are constant time
  - `top()`: O(1) - accessing last element is constant time
  - `getMin()`: O(1) - accessing last element is constant time

- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack
  - We maintain two stacks, each potentially storing up to n elements
  - In the worst case, both stacks will have the same number of elements
