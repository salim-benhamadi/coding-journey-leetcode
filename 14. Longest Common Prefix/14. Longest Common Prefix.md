# 14. Longest Common Prefix

## Problem Statement

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```python
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
* `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
* `strs[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        output = strs[0]
        for s in strs:
            if output == "": 
                return ""
            idx = min(len(s), len(output))
            for i in range(idx):
                if output[i] != s[i]:
                    output = output[:i]
                    break
            output = output[:idx]
        return output
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(S), where 
  - In the worst case, we need to compare each character of each string
  - For example, with strings ["abc", "abc", "abc"], we compare all characters
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use the output string to store the common prefix
  - Extra space used is constant regardless of input size
