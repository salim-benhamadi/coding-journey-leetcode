# 70. Climbing Stairs

## Problem Statement

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. The task is to find in how many distinct ways you can climb to the top.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= n <= 45`

## Solution

### 1. Recursive Solution (Time Limit Exceeded)
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0: return 1
        if n < 0: return 0
        return self.climbStairs(n-1) + self.climbStairs(n-2)
```

### 2. Dynamic Programming Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        memory = [0]*(n+1)
        for i in range(n+1):
            if i == 0 or i - 1 == 0: 
                memory[i] = 1
            else:
                memory[i] = memory[i-1] + memory[i-2]
        return memory[n]
```

### Complexity Analysis

1. Recursive Solution:
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n)
  - exponential due to redundant calculations
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - recursion stack depth

2. Dynamic Programming Solution:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - linear as we calculate each step once
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - memory array size
  - Improvement !: We can reduces space complexity from O(n) to O(1), by instrad of storing all intermediate results, we only keep track of the last two values
