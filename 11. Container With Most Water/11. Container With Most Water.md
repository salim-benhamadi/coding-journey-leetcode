# 11. Container With Most Water

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `height` of length `n` representing `n` vertical lines where the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`, find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that can store the maximum amount of water. Return the maximum amount of water the container can store.

**Note**: You may not slant the container.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: 
The array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] represents vertical lines.
The maximum area is formed between lines at index 1 and 8 (8 and 7 in height).
Area = width * height = (8 - 1) * min(8, 7) = 7 * 7 = 49
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Area = width * height = 1 * 1 = 1
```

## Constraints
* `n == height.length`
* `2 <= n <= 105`
* `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

## Solution

### 1. Brute Force Solution (Time Limit Exceeded)
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        for left in range(len(height)):
            for right in range(len(height)):
                current_area = (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right])
                max_area = max(max_area, current_area)
        return max_area
```

### 2. Two Pointer Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            current_area = (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right])
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
                
        return max_area
```

## Complexity Analysis

1. Brute Force Solution:
- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) nested loops iterating through all possible combinations
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)  only using constant extra space

2. Two Pointer Solution:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) single pass through the array using two pointers
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) only using constant extra space
