# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

## Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation:
The 2nd node from the end is 4, after removing it, the list becomes [1,2,3,5]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Explanation:
Removing the only node results in empty list
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation:
Removing the last node results in [1]
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= sz <= 30` where sz is the list size
* `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
* `1 <= n <= sz`

## Solution

### 1. Two Pass Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        node, length = head, 1
        while node.next:
            node = node.next
            length += 1

        if length - n == 0:
            return head.next
            
        node = head
        for i in range(length - n - 1):
            node = node.next
        node.next = node.next.next
        return head
```

### 2. One Pass Solution (Optimal)
```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        first = second = dummy
        for _ in range(n + 1):
            first = first.next   
        while first:
            first = first.next
            second = second.next
        second.next = second.next.next
        return dummy.next
```

## Complexity Analysis

1. Two Pass Solution:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) requires two passes through the list
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) only using constant extra space

2. One Pass Solution:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) single pass through the list
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) only using constant extra space
