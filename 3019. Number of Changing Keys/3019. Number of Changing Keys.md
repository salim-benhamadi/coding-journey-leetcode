# 3019. Number of Changing Keys

## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed string `s` typed by a user. Changing a key is defined as using a key different from the last used key. For example, `s = "ab"` has a change of a key while `s = "bBBb"` does not have any.

Return the number of times the user had to change the key.

**Note:** Modifiers like `shift` or `caps lock` won't be counted in changing the key. That is, if a user typed the letter `'a'` and then the letter `'A'`, it will not be considered as a changing of key.

## Input
* `s`: A string consisting of only upper case and lower case English letters where `1 <= s.length <= 100`

## Output
* An integer representing the number of key changes

## Constraints
* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s` consists of only upper case and lower case English letters

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aAbBcC"
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From s[0] = 'a' to s[1] = 'A', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
From s[1] = 'A' to s[2] = 'b', there is a change of key.
From s[2] = 'b' to s[3] = 'B', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
From s[3] = 'B' to s[4] = 'c', there is a change of key.
From s[4] = 'c' to s[5] = 'C', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "AaAaAaaA"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no change of key since only the letters 'a' and 'A' are pressed which does not require change of key.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "z"
Output: 0
Explanation: Single character requires no key changes.
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: s = "abcABC"
Output: 2
Explanation:
'a' to 'b': key change (count = 1)
'b' to 'c': key change (count = 2)
'c' to 'A': no change (same key, different case)
'A' to 'B': no change (same key 'b', different case)
'B' to 'C': no change (same key 'c', different case)
```

## Solution: Sequential Comparison Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def countKeyChanges(self, s: str) -> int:
        key_changes = 0
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i].lower() != s[i - 1].lower():
                key_changes += 1
        return key_changes
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string
  - Single pass through the string starting from index 1
  - Each comparison and `.lower()` operation is O(1)
  - Overall: O(n)

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using constant extra space for the counter
  - `.lower()` creates temporary strings but they're immediately discarded
  - No additional data structures needed
