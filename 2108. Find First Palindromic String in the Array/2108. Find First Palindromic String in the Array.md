# 2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array

## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words`, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string `""`.

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

## Input
* `words`: A list of strings where `1 <= words.length <= 100` and `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`

## Output
* A string representing the first palindrome found, or an empty string `""` if none exists

## Constraints
* `1 <= words.length <= 100`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
* `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
Output: "racecar"
Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.
```

## Solution : String Reversal Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def firstPalindrome(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        for word in words:
            if word == word[::-1]:
                return word
        return ""
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n × m), where n is the number of words and m is the average word length
  - Iterate through all words in worst case
  - For each word, create reversed string (O(m)) and compare (O(m))
  - Overall: O(n × m)

- **Space Complexity**: O(m)
  - String slicing `word[::-1]` creates a new reversed string of length m
  - Space proportional to the longest word
