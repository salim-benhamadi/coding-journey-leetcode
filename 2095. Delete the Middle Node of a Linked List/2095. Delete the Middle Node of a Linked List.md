# 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List

## Problem Statement

You are given the `head` of a linked list. **Delete** the **middle node**, and return *the* `head` *of the modified linked list*.

The **middle node** of a linked list of size `n` is the `⌊n / 2⌋th` node from the **start** using **0-based indexing**, where `⌊x⌋` denotes the largest integer less than or equal to `x`.
* For `n` = `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`, the middle nodes are `0`, `1`, `1`, `2`, and `2`, respectively.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
Explanation:
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node.
We return the new list after removing this node.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation:
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: head = [2,1]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node.
Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.
```

## Constraints
* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## Solution 1: Two-Pass Approach

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Handle edge cases
        if not head or not head.next:
            return None
            
        # First pass: count the length of the list
        node = head
        length = 0
        while node:
            length += 1
            node = node.next
        
        # Second pass: find the node before middle and delete middle
        node = head
        for i in range(length):
            if i == length // 2 - 1:
                node.next = node.next.next
                return head
            node = node.next
```
### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**:  O(n), requires two passes through the list
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), Only uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size

## Solution 2: Fast and Slow Pointers (One-Pass)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Handle edge cases
        if not head or not head.next:
            return None
            
        # Use slow and fast pointers
        slow = head
        fast = head.next.next
        
        # When fast reaches end, slow will be at node before middle
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
        # Delete the middle node
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
```
