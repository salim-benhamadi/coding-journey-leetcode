# 1137. N-th Tribonacci Number

## Problem Statement

The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows:
T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.
Given `n`, return the value of Tn.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```python
Input: n = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: n = 25
Output: 1389537
```

## Constraints
* `0 <= n <= 37`
* The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer, ie. `answer <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solution 1 (Dynamic Programming Approach)

```python
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        sequence = []
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i == 0:
                sequence.append(0)
            elif i == 1 or i == 2:
                sequence.append(1)
            else:
                sequence.append(sum(sequence[i-3:i]))
                
        return sequence[-1]
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We compute each Tribonacci number exactly once
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We store all Tribonacci numbers from T0 to Tn

## Solution 2 (Recursive Approach with Memoization)

```python
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        memo = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1}
        
        def recursive_trib(n):
            if n in memo:
                return memo[n]
            
            memo[n] = recursive_trib(n-1) + recursive_trib(n-2) + recursive_trib(n-3)
            return memo[n]
        
        return recursive_trib(n)
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Each value is calculated exactly once and cached
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We store all computed values in the memo dictionary
  - The recursion stack can go up to depth n
