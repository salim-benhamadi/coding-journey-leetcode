# 409. Longest Palindrome

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the **longest palindrome** that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
* `s` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_count = dict()
        palindrome_length = 0
        has_odd_count = 0
        
        # Count frequency of each character
        for char in s:
            char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1
        
        # Calculate palindrome length
        for count in char_count.values():
            remainder = count % 2
            palindrome_length += count - remainder
            has_odd_count = max(has_odd_count, remainder)
        
        return palindrome_length + has_odd_count
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string
  - We iterate through the string once to count characters
  - We then iterate through the character counts, which is at most 52 (26 lowercase + 26 uppercase letters)
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of unique characters
  - In the worst case, this is O(52) = O(1) since there are at most 52 unique characters
