# 1550. Three Consecutive Odds

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Input
* `arr`: An integer array where `1 <= arr.length <= 1000` and `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

## Output
* A boolean: `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers, `false` otherwise

## Constraints
* `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
Output: false
Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
Output: true
Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: arr = [1,1,1]
Output: true
Explanation: All three elements are odd and consecutive.
```


## Solution : Counter Approach

```python
class Solution2:
    def threeConsecutiveOdds(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        consecutive_count = 0

        for num in arr:
            if num % 2 == 1:
                consecutive_count += 1
                if consecutive_count == 3:
                    return True
            else:
                consecutive_count = 0

        return False
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array
  - Single pass through all elements
  - Each operation is O(1)

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using a single integer counter
  - True constant space
