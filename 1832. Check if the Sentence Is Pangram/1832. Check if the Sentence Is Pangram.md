# 1832. Check if the Sentence Is Pangram

## Problem Statement

A **pangram** is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once.

Given a string `sentence` containing only lowercase English letters, return `true` if `sentence` is a **pangram**, or `false` otherwise.

## Input
* `sentence`: A string consisting of only lowercase English letters where `1 <= sentence.length <= 1000`

## Output
* A boolean value: `true` if the sentence is a pangram, `false` otherwise

## Constraints
* `1 <= sentence.length <= 1000`
* `sentence` consists of lowercase English letters

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: sentence = "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence contains at least one of every letter of the English alphabet.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: sentence = "leetcode"
Output: false
Explanation: The sentence does not contain all 26 letters of the alphabet.
```

## Solution: Set Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfPangram(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
        return len(set(sentence)) == 26
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the sentence
  - Converting string to set requires iterating through all characters once
  - Set operations (add/lookup) are O(1) on average

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Set stores at most 26 unique lowercase English letters
  - Space usage is constant regardless of input size
