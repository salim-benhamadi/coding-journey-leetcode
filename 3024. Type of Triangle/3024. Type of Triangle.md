# 3024. Type of Triangle

## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `3` which can form the sides of a triangle.

* A triangle is called **equilateral** if it has all sides of equal length.
* A triangle is called **isosceles** if it has exactly two sides of equal length.
* A triangle is called **scalene** if all its sides are of different lengths.

Return a string representing the type of triangle that can be formed or `"none"` if it **cannot** form a triangle.

## Input
* `nums`: An integer array of size 3 where `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Output
* A string: `"equilateral"`, `"isosceles"`, `"scalene"`, or `"none"`

## Constraints
* `nums.length == 3`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,3,3]
Output: "equilateral"
Explanation: Since all the sides are of equal length, therefore, it will form an equilateral triangle.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,4,5]
Output: "scalene"
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 4 = 7, which is greater than nums[2] = 5.
nums[0] + nums[2] = 3 + 5 = 8, which is greater than nums[1] = 4.
nums[1] + nums[2] = 4 + 5 = 9, which is greater than nums[0] = 3. 
Since the sum of the two sides is greater than the third side for all three cases, therefore, it can form a triangle.
As all the sides are of different lengths, it will form a scalene triangle.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,4]
Output: "none"
Explanation: 1 + 2 = 3, which is not greater than 4, so it cannot form a triangle.
```

## Solution: Set-based Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def triangleType(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        unique_sides = len(set(nums))
        a, b, c = nums
        
        # Check triangle inequality
        if (a + b <= c) or (a + c <= b) or (b + c <= a):
            return "none"
        
        # Determine triangle type based on unique sides
        if unique_sides == 1: 
            return "equilateral"
        elif unique_sides == 2: 
            return "isosceles"
        else: 
            return "scalene"
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - Set operations on 3 elements are constant time
  - Triangle inequality checks are constant time operations
  - All operations are independent of input size

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Set stores at most 3 unique elements
  - Constant additional space used
