# 242. Valid Anagram

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution: Character Frequency Counter

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, first_str: str, second_str: str) -> bool:
        # If lengths are different, they cannot be anagrams
        if len(first_str) != len(second_str):
            return False

        freq_first, freq_second = {}, {}
    
        for i in range(len(first_str)):
            freq_first[first_str[i]] = freq_first.get(first_str[i], 0) + 1
            freq_second[second_str[i]] = freq_second.get(second_str[i], 0) + 1
            
        return freq_first == freq_second
```


### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input strings
  - We iterate through both strings once, and dictionary operations are generally O(1)
  - Dictionary comparison is also O(n) in the worst case

- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the size of the character set
  - In this case, with lowercase English letters, k is at most 26
  - In the worst case, we store all unique characters from both strings
