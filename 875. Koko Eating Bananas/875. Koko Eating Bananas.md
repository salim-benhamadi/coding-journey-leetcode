# 875. Koko Eating Bananas

## Problem Statement

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return *the minimum integer* `k` *such that she can eat all the bananas within* `h` *hours*.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
* `piles.length <= h <= 10^9`
* `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution: Binary Search on Answer

```python
import math

class Solution:
    def calculate_time(self, eating_speed: int, h: int, piles: List[int]):
        total_hours = 0
        for pile_size in piles:
            total_hours += math.ceil(float(pile_size) / eating_speed)
        return total_hours
    
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        min_speed, max_speed = 1, max(piles)
        result = max_speed
        
        while min_speed <= max_speed:
            mid_speed = (max_speed + min_speed) // 2
            time_needed = self.calculate_time(mid_speed, h, piles)
            
            if time_needed <= h:
                result = mid_speed
                max_speed = mid_speed - 1
            else:
                min_speed = mid_speed + 1
                
        return result
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * log(max(piles))), where n is the number of piles
  - Binary search runs in O(log(max(piles))) iterations
  - Each iteration calls calculate_time which takes O(n) time to process all piles
  - Overall: O(n * log(max(piles)))

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables
