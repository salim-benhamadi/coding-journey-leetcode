# 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

## Problem Statement

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequences are the same. Given the roots of two binary trees `root1` and `root2`, return `true` if and only if they are leaf-similar.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```python
Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
Output: false
```

## Constraints
* The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range `[1, 200]`
* Both trees will have values in the range `[0, 200]`

## Solution

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        
class Solution:
    def leafSimilar(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        # Edge case check
        if not root1 or not root2:
            return False
            
        # Get leaf sequence of first tree
        stack = []
        leaves = []
        current = root1
        
        while current or stack:
            # Traverse to leftmost node
            while current:
                stack.append(current)
                current = current.left
                
            # Process current node
            current = stack.pop()
            
            # If leaf node, add to sequence
            if not current.left and not current.right:
                leaves.append(current.val)
                
            # Move to right subtree
            current = current.right
            
        # Compare with leaf sequence of second tree
        stack = []
        leaf_index = 0
        current = root2
        
        while current or stack:
            # Traverse to leftmost node
            while current:
                stack.append(current)
                current = current.left
                
            # Process current node
            current = stack.pop()
            
            # If leaf node, compare with first tree's sequence
            if not current.left and not current.right:
                if leaf_index >= len(leaves):
                    return False
                if current.val != leaves[leaf_index]:
                    return False
                leaf_index += 1
                
            # Move to right subtree
            current = current.right
            
        # Check if all leaves from first tree were matched
        return leaf_index == len(leaves)
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n and m are the number of nodes in the two trees
  - We traverse each node of both trees exactly once
- **Space Complexity**: O(h1 + h2 + l), where h1 and h2 are the heights of the trees and l is the number of leaves
  - Stack space: O(h1) and O(h2) for tree traversals
  - Leaves array: O(l) to store leaf sequence from first tree
