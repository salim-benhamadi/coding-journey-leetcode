# 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

## Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list **sorted** as well.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```python
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

## Constraints
* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
* The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order

## Solution

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
        
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        current = head
        
        while current and current.next:
            if current.val == current.next.val:
                current.next = current.next.next
            else:
                current = current.next
                
        return head
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
  - We traverse each node in the list exactly once
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We modify the list in-place
  - Only use one pointer variable regardless of input size
