# 657. Robot Return to Origin

## Problem Statement

There is a robot starting at the position `(0, 0)`, the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at `(0, 0)` after it completes its moves.

You are given a string `moves` that represents the move sequence of the robot where `moves[i]` represents its `ith` move. Valid moves are `'R'` (right), `'L'` (left), `'U'` (up), and `'D'` (down).

Return `true` if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. `'R'` will always make the robot move to the right once, `'L'` will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.

## Input
* `moves`: A string where `1 <= moves.length <= 2 × 10^4` containing only characters `'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'`, and `'R'`

## Output
* A boolean: `true` if robot returns to origin, `false` otherwise

## Constraints
* `1 <= moves.length <= 2 × 10^4`
* `moves` only contains the characters `'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'` and `'R'`

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: moves = "UD"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: moves = "LL"
Output: false
Explanation: The robot moves left twice. It ends up two "moves" to the left of the origin. We return false because it is not at the origin at the end of its moves.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: moves = "RRLL"
Output: true
Explanation: Right twice and left twice returns to origin.
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: moves = "LRUD"
Output: true
Explanation: One move in each direction returns to origin.
```

## Solution 1: Dictionary Counting Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:
        move_count = {'R': 0, 'L': 0, 'D': 0, 'U': 0}
        for move in moves:
            move_count[move] += 1
        return move_count["U"] == move_count["D"] and move_count["R"] == move_count["L"]
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of moves string
  - Single pass through all moves
  - Each dictionary operation is O(1)

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Dictionary has fixed size of 4 keys
  - Space doesn't grow with input size

## Solution 2: String Count Approach

```python
class Solution3:
    def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:
        return moves.count('U') == moves.count('D') and moves.count('R') == moves.count('L')
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of moves string
  - Four passes through the string (one for each count)
  - Each count operation is O(n)
  - Overall: 4 × O(n) = O(n)

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - No extra space needed
