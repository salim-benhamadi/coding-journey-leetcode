# 141. Linked List Cycle

## Problem Statement

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. A cycle exists if some node in the list can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation:
There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation:
There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation:
There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

## Constraints
* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`
* `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
* `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked list

## Solution

### 1. Value Modification Approach
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        node = head
        while node:
            if node.val == "checked": 
                return True
            node.val = "checked"
            node = node.next
        return False
```

### 2. Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm (Optimal)
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False
        
        slow = head
        fast = head.next
        
        while fast:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next if fast.next else fast.next
            if slow == fast:
                return True
        return False
```

## Complexity Analysis

1. Value Modification Approach:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only modify existing nodes
- **Note**: This approach modifies the original list structure which might not be desired

2. Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use two pointers
- **Note**: This approach maintains the original list structure and is generally preferred
