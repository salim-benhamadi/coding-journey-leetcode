# 2215. Find the Difference of Two Arrays

## Problem Statement

Given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return a list `answer` of size `2` where:
* `answer[0]` is a list of all **distinct** integers in `nums1` which are **not** present in `nums2`.
* `answer[1]` is a list of all **distinct** integers in `nums2` which are **not** present in `nums1`.

The integers in the lists may be returned in **any** order.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```python
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
Explanation:
For nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present in nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].
For nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present in nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums1. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,3], nums2 = [1,1,2,2]
Output: [[3],[]]
Explanation:
For nums1, nums1[2] and nums1[3] are not present in nums2. Since nums1[2] == nums1[3], their value is only included once and answer[0] = [3].
Every integer in nums2 is present in nums1. Therefore, answer[1] = [].
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
* `-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findDifference(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        set1 = set(nums1)
        set2 = set(nums2)
        
        return [list(set1 - set2), list(set2 - set1)]
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of nums1 and nums2
  - Converting arrays to sets takes O(n) and O(m)
  - Set difference operations take O(min(n, m))
  - Converting results back to lists takes O(n) and O(m) in worst case
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m)
  - Space for the two sets and result lists
