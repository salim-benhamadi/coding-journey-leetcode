# 2942. Find Words Containing Character

## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array of strings `words` and a character `x`.

Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character `x`.

Note that the returned array may be in any order.

## Input
* `words`: A list of strings where `1 <= words.length <= 50` and `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
* `x`: A lowercase English letter

## Output
* A list of integers representing the indices of words containing character `x`

## Constraints
* `1 <= words.length <= 50`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
* `x` is a lowercase English letter
* `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
Output: []
Explanation: "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.
```

## Solution: List Comprehension Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def findWordsContaining(self, words: List[str], x: str) -> List[int]:
        return [i for i in range(len(words)) if x in words[i]]
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n × m), where n is the number of words and m is the average word length
  - Iterate through all n words
  - For each word, the `in` operator checks up to m characters
  - Overall: O(n × m)

- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of matching indices
  - Output list contains at most n indices (if all words contain the character)
  - No additional data structures used beyond the result
